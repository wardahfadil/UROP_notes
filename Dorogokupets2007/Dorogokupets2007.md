###Helmholtz free energy, differentiate
![Helmholtz function](https://github.com/wardahfadil/UROP_notes/blob/master/Dorogokupets2007/Helmholtz%20Free%20Energy%20Eqn.jpg)
	- thermodynamic potential that measures the 'useful' work obtainable from a closed 	   thermodynamic system at constant temperature.
	- *closed system*: in physics, closed systems can exchange energy (as heat or work) but not matter.
	- *isolated system*: in physics, a thermodynamic system that is completely enclosed by walls such that matter and energy cannot pass through although they can move around inside it.
	- commonly used for systems held at **constant volume**.
	- the negative of the difference of Helmholtz energy is the max amount of work that the system can perform in a thermodynamic process where T is constant.
	- at constant T and V, Helmholtz energy is minimized at equilibrium.

###Entropy
- in thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of disorder.
- a *state function*: a property of the system that only depends on the current state (a system identified by values of a set of parameters, 'state variables') of the system.
- 2nd law of thermodynamics: the entropy of an isolated system will spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium (max entropy). Systems that are not isolated may decrease in entropy if they increase the entropy of their environment by the same amount.

###Mie-Gruneisen EOS
- the relation between pressure and volume of solid at a given temperature.
- determine pressure in a shock-compressed solid.
- a special form of Gruneisen model that describes the effect of changing the volume of a crystal lattice on its vibrational properties.
- *Gruneisen Parameter*: describes the effect of changing the volume of crystal lattice on its vibrational properties, thus, the effect of changing temperature on the size or dynamics of the lattice. 

### Brillouin scattering
- interaction between electromagnetic wave and crystalline lattice waves 
- inelastic scattering; photon may lose energy to create one of the three quasiparticle types (phonons, polarons or magnons), or gain energy by absorbing one.
- the shift in photon energy (Brillouin shift in frequency), is equal to the energy of released/absorbed quasiparticle.
- used to measure the energies, wavelengths and frequencies of various quasiparticles (atomic chain oscillation types) 

 
- anharmonicity
- Mie-Gruneisen-Debye
- q parameter
- bulk moduli
