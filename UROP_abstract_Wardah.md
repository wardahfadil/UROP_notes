##### Research Title: Developing A Universal Pressure Scale for High Pressure-Temperature   Experiments
##### Mentor: Dr. Aaron Wolf

The materials within the Earth are subjected to high pressures and temperatures, and thus in order to understand the behavior of these materials at different depths, geoscientists rely on pressure scales and equations of state.
Pressure scales are constructed through numerous high pressure-temperature experiments such as shock wave experiments and also static experiments that apply the use of multi-anvil cell and diamond anvil cell, which are able to replicate the extreme pressure and temperature conditions in the upper mantle. The experiments use various internal pressure standards such as Au, Pt, MgO, Neon, and NaCl. In a static experiment, tests on multiple pressure standards using the same parameters are carried out simultaneously while in a shock wave experiment, tests on each pressure standard are conducted separately. A set of equations of state that defines the pressure scale for each pressure standard is then constructed. 
	
A major complication that arises from the use of these pressure scales is that discrepancies exist between the reported pressure values within a given pressure standard as well as between data obtained from static and shock wave experiments.
My research attempts to help resolve this through the construction of a database for both the measurements and parameters obtained in each experiment by extracting and digitizing data from research journals.
I then analyze the data obtained from static experiments using various pressure standards and attempt to minimize the difference between the pressure scales for these materials.
I also analyze the data obtained from shock wave experiments using different pressure standards, compare observed pressure values obtained from the experiment with values obtained from the proposed equation of state, and attempt to minimize the difference between these values.
In the long run this project, known as the UnBIASeD (Unified Bayesian Iterative and Systematically Determined) Pressure Scale Project, attempts to construct a set of pressure scales that agrees with both static and shock wave data across a diverse group of pressure standards.
