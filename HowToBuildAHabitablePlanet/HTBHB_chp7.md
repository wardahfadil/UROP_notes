# How did the Earth's layers form?
- Heterogenous accretion theory
	- layers of different composition formed one by one
	- iron core formed first, followed by silicate layers
	- doesn't make sense because current observations show that the Earth's crust
	  is continually being formed from materials under the Earth, not by meteorite impacts
	- it would also have to mean that iron and nickel should be the first elements to 
	  form (precipitate from nebular gas) in the solar system, this is not the case
	  as silicate materials are the first to solidify 
	- both iron and silicates are present simultaneously in interstellar clouds, thus 
	  iron cannot be the only element present in the solar system during Earth formation
	  
- Homogenous accretion theory
	- a mix of material were present during Earth's accretion, stratification occurred
	  later on to form separate the separate layers
	- denser material sank (iron and nickel) to form the Earth's core and less dense 
	  silicates formed the mantle and crust 
	- outgassing of volatile materials formed the atmosphere and hydrosphere
	- reasonable because: 
		1. metal is denser than silicates, should sink to the center of the Earth
		2. density separation possible due to immiscible property of metals and silicates
