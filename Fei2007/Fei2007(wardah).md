## Toward an internally consistent pressure scale

##### What is it about?

- created an internally consistent thermal equations of state of Au(gold), Pt(platinum), NaCl-B2(?), and solid Ne.
- by finding compression data of Au(gold), Pt(platinum), NaCl-B2, and solid Ne at 300K and high T.
- provide XRD measurements of Ne and NaCl up to megabar pressures at room temperature and high temperatures.
- propose two Ne and NaCl-B2 pressure scales that are consistent with the gold and platinum pressure scales and ruby pressure gauge.
- propose a Pt scale by fitting room-T compression data of Dewaele et al. and the PVT data of Fei et al. to thermal equations of state (obtained using Mie-Gruneisen relation).
  - what is [equation of state]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state)?

*XRD - chemical analysis method involving the bombardment of a target metal with electrons to produce x-ray diffractions, to infer the crystal structure of the material, use Bragg's Law to determine the d-spacing (space between lattices).*

##### Inside the Earth

![Earth layers] (http://www.spring8.or.jp/en/news_publications/research_highlights/no57_img/fig1.png)

- Earth's layers: crust, upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle, outer core, inner core.
- boundaries between layers are determined through seismic velocity discontinuities
- seismic velocity discontinuities due to different chemical composition, pressure and temperature in these layers.
- seismic discointinuity ~400 km: transformation of alpha-olivine to betha-phase (wadsleyite), ~670 km: transformation of gamma-spinel (ringwoodite) to silicate-perovskite plus.

*Olivine is a type of nesosilicate, a mineral that is most abundant in the upper mantle.*

-"D-layer" : a region at the base of the lower mantle (122-136 GPa; 2650-2891 km), associated with the postperovksite mineral transition phase.

##### Why do we need consistent (universal) pressure scales?
- to better understand the composition and behavior of different layers of the Earth through accurate measurement of pressure and temperature at different depths.
- high P-T experiments are conducted worldwide and use of different P-T scales would produce contradictory results.
- - leads to *different estimates of density deficit in the inner core* thus, different interpretations of material behavior in the inner core.

##### What do we have right now?
- **synchrotron radiation, ruby luminescent pressure gauge?**
- **Mao ruby scale**: used for pressure determination under hydrostatic conditions.
  - calibrated up to 80 GPa by using reduced shockwave equations of state of copper and gold.
  - underestimates pressures, particularly above 40 GPa? why?
  - direct pressure measurements using Brillouin scattering and XRD indicates that it is a quasihydrostatic ruby scale, accurate within 2% up to the max pressure (55GPa) of the measurements.
    - **[what is reduced shockwave equation of state](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~sue/TJA_LindhurstLabWebsite/ListPublications/Papers_pdf/Seismo_1656.pdf)?**
  - have to look back at the metal pressure scales of metals that are used as pressure standars, inconsistency leads to the inaccuracy of Mao ruby scale
    - discrepancy between gold and platinum scales is the main cause of uncertainty in the ruby scale
- Anderson Au scale is questionable due to prediction of postspinel phase at a depth shallower then 660km discontinuity.
- Birch-Murnaghan equation of state?
- Vinet equation of state?
- How does different pressure medium in XRD and choice of reference temperature effect the equation of state?
  - XRD infers the crystal structure --> mineral identification?
  - reference temperature relates to depth in the Earth?
- Jamieson and Holmes Pt scale predict higher pressures than any other metal pressure scales.

##### What did they do?
- conducted static compression experiments using diamond anvil cell to obtain compression data
  - which would then be used to find equations of state --> pressure scale?
  - 1st experiment: check the EOS of gold by using ruby as pressure calibrant.
  - 2nd experiment: determine the PVT EOS of NaCl by using platinum as the internal standard.
  - 3rd experimant: obtain PVT data of solid neon while using neon as pressure medium and gold and platinum as internal standards.
