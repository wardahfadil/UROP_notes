##### Research Title: Developing A Universal Pressure Scale for High Pressure-Temperature   Experiments
##### Mentor: Dr. Aaron Wolf

The materials under the Earth are subjected to high pressure and temperature and in order to understand the behavior of these materials at different depths, geoscientists refer to pressure scales and equations of state. Pressure scales are constructed through numerous high pressure-temperature experiments using various internal pressure standards such as Au, Pt, MgO, Neon, NaCl-B1 and NaCl-B2. The data is obtained through both static and shockwave experiments and a set of equation of state that defines the pressure scale for each pressure standard is then constructed. 
	
The complication that arises from the various pressure scales that are constructed is that there are various discrepancies between these pressure scales for the same pressure standard in addition to discrepancies between data obtained from static and shockwave experiments. My research attempts to resolve this by constructing a database of the parameters used in each experiment by extracting and digitizing data from research journals. I then analyze the data obtained from static experiments using various pressure standards and attempt to minimize the difference between the pressure scales of these pressure standards. I also analyze the data obtained from shockwave experiments using different pressure standards, compare observed presssure values obtained from the experiment with values obtained from the proposed equation of state, and attempt to minimize the difference betweeen these values. In the long run, this project known as Unified Bayesian Iterative and Systematically Determined Pressure Scale Project, attempts to construct a pressure scale that agrees with both static and shockwave data.
